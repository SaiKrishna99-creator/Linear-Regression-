# Linear-Regression-

->My motive of this project was to get an hands-on experience on the Logistic Regression Algorithm.<br>
I have attached the data file (auto-mpg.data-original) and also the file describing each feature of the dataset (auto-mpg.names)
-> The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes.
-> The target variable in this dataset is 'mpg'
